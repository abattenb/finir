# finir

> A completion app.

fenir mean 'to finish'. This is a personal completion app, customized to my daily needs.

## Goals

* Color as a motivator
* [IKEA Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect) + 'Yet Another Todo'
* Forgiveness-as-a-Service
* Novelity as reward

## Concepts

* Every day brings a new color, a new chance
* Every day should be completable
* Streaks are a *reflection* of the reward, not the 'reward' itself
* Anti-data: you cannot interact with the past

## Thoughts

It's amazing how different an experience can be when you aren't mining data..

A todo list is the developer equivalent of an industrial designer's chair..

Naming concepts frames everything. 'Challenges' vs 'Todos'..

The icons may be pushing too hard into 'Fear of Missing Out'..

When was the last time an app or service _forgave_ you?..
