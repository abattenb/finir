# finir

> A completion app.

fenir mean 'to finish'. This is a personal completion app, customized to my daily needs.

## Goals

* Color as a motivator
* [IKEA Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect) + 'Yet Another Todo'
* Forgiveness-as-a-Service

## Concepts

* Every day brings a new color, a new chance
* Every day should be completable
* Streaks are a *reflection* of the reward, not the 'reward' itself
* Anti-data: you cannot interact with the past

## Thoughts

It's amazing how different an experience can be when you aren't mining data..

A todo list is the developer equivalent of am industrial designer's chair..

Naming concepts frames everything. 'Challenges' vs 'Todos'..

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
